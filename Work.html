         My Profession Carrer
      </header>
      <p>
         I am currently working as a Technical Engineer 1 at Model N. I joined the company as a fresh graduate and have been honing my skills and gaining valuable experience over the past few years. Although I am still in the early stages of my career, with less than three years of work experience, I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to innovative solutions in the field.
      </p>

          Working as a Technical Engineer realy helped me to understand the customer point of view and how Operation teams work in a SAAS organization.
